## Features and Benefits of Swar Studio
 
Swar Studio is designed to be a user-friendly and versatile DAW that can handle any genre of music, but especially Indian music. Here are some of the features and benefits that make Swar Studio stand out from other DAWs:
 
- **Built-in virtual instruments:** Swar Studio comes with 41 high-quality virtual instruments that cover a wide range of sounds, from acoustic to electric, from western to eastern. You can use them to create realistic and expressive melodies, harmonies and rhythms. Some of the Indian instruments included are: Bansuri, Dhol, Harmonium, Sitar, Tabla, Tanpura and more. You can also load your own VSTi/Audio Units synths if you want to expand your sonic palette.
- **MIDI loops library:** Swar Studio includes a library panel with hundreds of ready-made MIDI loops that you can drag and drop into your project. These loops are organized by category, such as drums, bass, guitar, piano, strings, etc. You can also filter them by genre, such as Bollywood, classical, folk, fusion, pop, rock, etc. You can use these loops as they are or edit them to suit your needs. You can also create your own MIDI loops and save them in the library for future use.
- **Karaoke functionality:** Swar Studio allows you to record your own voice on a new audio track or just sing along with friends. You can use the built-in microphone or connect an external one. You can also adjust the volume, pitch and pan of your voice track. Swar Studio also supports lyrics display and creation in different notations, including Indian scripts. You can import lyrics from text files or enter them manually. You can also sync the lyrics with the music using the karaoke editor.
- **Automation:** Swar Studio supports full automation of parameters such as volume, pan, mute, solo, send levels and effects. You can use automation to create dynamic changes in your music over time. You can draw automation curves using the mouse or record them in real time using a MIDI controller. You can also copy and paste automation data between tracks or across projects.
- **Bounce/Freeze tracks:** Swar Studio allows you to bounce or freeze tracks to save CPU and memory resources. Bouncing a track means rendering it to an audio file that replaces the original track. Freezing a track means rendering it to an audio file that is temporarily stored in memory and can be unfrozen later. Both methods allow you to reduce the number of active tracks and plugins in your project without losing any data.
- **Export options:** Swar Studio allows you to export your project to audio or MIDI files that you can share with others or use in other applications. You can export your project as a whole or as individual tracks. You can also choose the format, quality and location of your exported files.
